# Automate

**Automate** is an open-source Scratch mod server program that lets you automate programs and workflows on your PC using custom Scratch extensions. With Automate, your Scratch projects can interact with a wide range of applications and services — all running locally on your computer.

## What is Automate?

Automate allows you to create and run custom Scratch extensions that communicate with other programs, services, or hardware on your PC. Instead of being limited to just Scratch’s built-in blocks, you can extend Scratch to control and automate many different things — from launching apps, manipulating files, to interacting with web APIs and more.

It’s built on **Scrooch 3**, a flexible Scratch 3 modding framework, which means it’s fully customizable and open for power users to expand.
